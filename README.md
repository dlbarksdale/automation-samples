# Automation Samples

This repository contains small, representative examples of how I approach
test automation, API validation, and CI integration.

Most of my professional work has been performed on proprietary systems and
private repositories. These samples are intentionally minimal and anonymized,
and are meant to demonstrate patterns, structure, and decision-making rather
than full production implementations.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- API testing patterns using Pytest
- Clear, maintainable test structure
- CI integration concepts (GitHub Actions)
- A pragmatic, reliability-focused approach to quality engineering

## What This Repository Does Not Represent

- Full production systems
- Employer or client code
- Complete frameworks or exhaustive coverage

I’m happy to discuss architecture, tradeoffs, and real-world implementations
in interviews.
